### 1. Introduction
The **Meta Messaging API** provides seamless integration with Meta platforms, such as WhatsApp and Instagram. Designed with scalability, security, and production-readiness in mind, it offers messaging capabilities, template management, and analytics in a structured and maintainable framework.

---

### 2. Project Objectives
- Simplify messaging integration with Meta platforms.
- Provide a secure, efficient, and scalable API.
- Enable developers to manage messaging templates and analytics effectively.

---

### 3. Architecture Overview
#### Core Components:
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for Python.
- **MongoDB**: For persistent data storage.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and rate-limiting.
- **Docker**: Containerized environment for deployment.

#### Application Structure:
- **API Endpoints**: Organized for WhatsApp, Instagram, templates, and statistics.
- **Services Layer**: Implements business logic.
- **Core Utilities**: Handles database, caching, and validation.

---

### 4. Key Features
- **Message Integration**: Streamline messaging with WhatsApp and Instagram.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health endpoints for observability.
- **Security**: Implemented trusted host validation, CORS, and rate limiting.
- **Documentation**: Swagger UI for interactive API exploration.

---

### 5. Security Practices
- Non-root Docker containers.
- Enforced CORS policies.
- Environment-based configuration to prevent leaks.

---

### 6. Deployment Guide
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kanopusdev/Meta.git
   cd Meta
   ```
2. Configure environment variables in `.env`.
3. Build and run using Docker Compose:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### 7. Scaling and Performance
- Use Redis for high-speed caching.
- Employ horizontal scaling with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
- Monitor with Prometheus and alerts.

---

### 8. Development Workflow
- Develop locally with Docker Compose.
- Write tests to ensure code reliability.
- Use structured logging for easier debugging.

---

### 9. API Documentation
Access Swagger UI at `/docs` for detailed API documentation.

---

### 10. Contributing Guidelines
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Follow the coding standards outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Submit pull requests for review.
